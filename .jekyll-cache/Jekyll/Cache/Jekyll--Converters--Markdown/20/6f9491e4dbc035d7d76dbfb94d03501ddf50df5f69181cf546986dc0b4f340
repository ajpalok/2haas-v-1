<p>Drawing by: Abrar Jahin</p>

<p>I have brought a set of pencils in different shades.. After that washed my hands to use the pencils.. You also wash your hands to watch this video ğŸ¤£.. This drawing is drawn from a frame of Pinterest.</p>

<p>Watch the video:</p>

<p>Here I used <strong>Artline</strong> pencils (HB, 4B, 10B). Graphites are so soft to draw, simply loved it. We can see many videos in online like <strong>How To Draw Eye</strong>, <strong>Eye Drawings</strong>, <strong>realistic eye drawing</strong> etc. So I thought, â€œWhy not just draw the same thing but little bit different?â€ And done in 1 and half hours</p>
