I"c<p>Sketch of Saviska Riya<br />
Drawing by : Abrar Jahin</p>

<p>In the moment of passing my boring times, I found the original frame from my brother and started to copy that in an offset page..<br />
First time in the sketch, I hardly able to recognise her in that sketch..<br />
Second day I started to sketch that again and yep now itâ€™s a bit recognizable.</p>
