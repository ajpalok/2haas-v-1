<p>This was the first time I draw in Autodesk app and really loved the app.. The first thing is a lot of tools are available and second thing is very much user and eco friendly..</p>

<p>This drawing idea is taken from the Instagram ID: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_teacoholic_/">@<em>teacoholic</em></a>.. An amazing <strong>ID</strong> for publishing many tea basis frames. Follow her ID for more amazing portraits of teas.</p>

<p>But unfortunately, the video of the 1st drawing deleted accidentally before backing up and then tried for 2 times more to shoot a video but the same thing occurred… But fortunately 3rd time got success and that’s the video you watched there. Here is the result of 3rd attempt:</p>

<p>But to be honest I like the first one! What do you think? Comment through Email..</p>

<p>Thanks for watching.. <strong>Stay Tuned</strong></p>
