## Description:

I was feeling, bored, then I started random sketch to pass the boring time. But! What did I find after the sketch was done, was unexpected.  
  
I was shocked! I could not recognize that whom I was trying to sketch and that face was horrible to see. I was thinking, "Is it even a human or something else?!" *_*   Then I was searching for a face to sketch.. Suddenly I found a face in my gallery and yup I successfully killed my time.. :')
