Sketch of Saviska Riya  
Drawing by : Abrar Jahin  
  
In the moment of passing my boring times, I found the original frame from my brother and started to copy that in an offset page..  
First time in the sketch, I hardly able to recognise her in that sketch..  
Second day I started to sketch that again and yep now it's a bit recognizable.  
  
Umm so give a thumbs up if you like and you can also share you are drawings in our website.. What you have to do is, [Email](https://2haas.tk/contact/) us with your drawing.
Thanks for watching and I hope you will share it..
