This drawing was created from a frame. Our very first post in our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/2haas) this drawing was..
At that time when I was making the drawing, I was finding a topic to draw.. Suddenly!  I found the frame of Sir Tamzeed Alam Token and loved that.. So I decided to draw that!.. And this I have made..
