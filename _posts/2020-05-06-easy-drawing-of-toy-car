While I was thinking to do a <b>Easy Drawing Of A Toy Car</b>, can't get any idea that time. When, started to find some drawing ideas for beginners.. Then found the frame. How I draw this? Watch:

But I was wondering how to draw this? Should I just sketch or draw? Started to sketch but can't satisfied with that only.. Then I dare to do that :3
