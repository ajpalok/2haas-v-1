Title: Macro Eye Sketch

Drawing by: Abrar Jahin

I have brought a set of pencils in different shades.. After that washed my hands to use the pencils.. You also wash your hands to watch this video ðŸ¤£.. This drawing is drawn from a frame of Pinterest.  
  
Watch the video:

Here I used **Artline** pencils (HB, 4B, 10B). Graphites are so soft to draw, simply loved it. We can see many videos in online like **How To Draw Eye**, **Eye Drawings**, **realistic eye drawing** etc. So I thought, "Why not just draw the same thing but little bit different?" And done in 1 and half hours
