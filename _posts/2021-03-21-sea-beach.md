This amazing sight of sea beach was drawn with oil pastels and pencil colors.

Here I used **Oil Pastel, Color pencils** in colors and half of **A4 Size Paper**.. This Drawing took around 1 Hour and 58 Minutes to complete. But the main portrait is more darkish.. Comment below your thoughts about this portrait.. Stay tuned...
